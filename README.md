# Loan Default Data Prediction & Risk Analysis
The project focus on loan default prediction using machine learning to classify high-risk borrowers. It involves data preprocessing (pandas, NumPy), feature engineering, model selection (scikit-learn), and hyperparameter tuning (Optuna). Performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC, precision-recall, and F1 score, optimizing risk assessment strategies.
